    <p>Question No. 8</p>
    <p>
        Create a JavaScript class named Person with a constructor that takes two parameters: name and age.
        The class should have a method named introduce that logs a greeting message including 
        the person's name and age.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next, create a subclass of Person named Student.
        The Student class should have an additional property named major and an overridden introduce method.
        The overridden introduce method should log a message that includes the person's name, age, and major.
    </p>
